# Tips:
#
# Averaging over the unstable box solutions seems to give the same answer as
# many stable steps! So, use the unstable convergence followed by fewer
# slow stable small mixing steps. Speed the slow part by taking occasional large
# steps when the percentage deviation change becomes low, then burn off the
# rounding error to (hopefully) get faster convergence.
#
# Comparisons:
# Using just small steps (0.0001) converges below only 0.3 in 5500 iterations.
# Adding occasional big steps (0.1) to this is unstable (loses solution).
# Box averaging for 500 steps followed by just small steps converges below
# 10^-3 in 5000 (+500) steps.
# Box averaging for 500 steps followed by small with occasional big steps converges 
# to below 10^-4 in under 4000 (+500) iterations.
#
# For larger mj (4096 or bigger), iterate with smaller mix for a while until stable, then switch
# back to 0.01 for a few hundred iterations more.
